# Alarm Clock

[Idioma espa√±ol](./readme.md)

This is an alarm clock made in Tkinter for the purpose of setting an alarm on my computer. It was developed on Windows, but hasn't been tested on Linux yet. It's only in Spanish, but I'll probably translate it to English.

## Possible Errors

### Fonts not displaying correctly

In the root folder, there is a folder called **fonts**, which contains the fonts used in the project. Install them and restart the application.

### Dependencies
This project uses **Pillow** for images (custom widgets) and **PyGame** (sound). Make sure you have them installed before running.

You can use the following command in the root directory to install these libraries:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
